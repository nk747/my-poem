two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Now finally i edited it as master.
cloned on my local pc
when i edited on pc. i ran command git push.

typing this line on github.
now to update on my pc i should run git pull.
